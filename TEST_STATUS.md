# CyberOps Game Test Suite Status

## Overview
The test framework includes 30 total tests across 4 test suites. Currently **19 tests are fully functional** without DOM dependencies, while 11 tests are skipped due to DOM requirements.

## Working Tests (19 tests) ✅

### Simple Test Suite (7/7 tests passing)
- ✅ Game instance initialized
- ✅ Dialog engine initialized
- ✅ Campaigns loaded
- ✅ Agents loaded (waits for async load)
- ✅ Basic dialog navigation
- ✅ Dialog stack handling
- ✅ Dialog config structure

### Basic Dialog Tests (10/10 tests passing)
- ✅ Dialog engine state count validation
- ✅ Navigate to simple dialogs without data
- ✅ Dialog stack depth management
- ✅ Dialog transitions
- ✅ State data persistence through navigation
- ✅ Dialog closing functionality
- ✅ Rapid navigation handling
- ✅ Config structure validation
- ✅ Back navigation from root
- ✅ Refresh without state loss

## Skipped Tests (11 tests) ⏭️

### Dialog Conversion Tests (5 active, 3 skipped)
- ⏭️ Identical behavior for duplicate functions (needs DOM)
- ✅ Navigate through all dialog states
- ✅ Back navigation handling
- ⏭️ Refresh without flicker (needs DOM)
- ⏭️ Button functionality preservation (needs DOM buttons)
- ⏭️ Keyboard shortcuts (needs DOM events)
- ✅ Navigation stack depth
- ⏭️ Complete dialog state capture (needs DOM)

### State Machine Tests (3 active, 2 skipped)
- ⏭️ Validate all documented transitions (needs DOM buttons)
- ✅ Reach all states from hub or game
- ⏭️ Handle navigation cycles (needs DOM buttons)
- ✅ Maintain consistent stack depth
- ✅ Handle rapid navigation without errors

## Test Execution Guide

### Run All Working Tests
Click "RUN ALL TESTS" to execute all 17 working tests plus any partially working suites.

### Run Specific Suites
- **Simple Tests**: Always work, no DOM needed
- **Dialog Tests**: Mix of working and skipped tests
- **State Machine Tests**: Mix of working and skipped tests

### Test Summary
Click "TEST SUMMARY" button to see a detailed breakdown of all available tests.

## Known Issues

1. **DOM Dependencies**: Tests that try to access buttons, dialog elements, or trigger UI events fail in the test environment
2. **Navigation Validation**: Some dialogs (hire-confirm, npc-interaction) require specific data to navigate to
3. **Imperative Functions**: Old-style dialog functions (showAgentManagement, etc.) directly manipulate DOM

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on Logic Tests**: Continue adding tests for game logic that don't require DOM
2. **Mock DOM Elements**: Consider adding a mock DOM layer for UI tests
3. **Separate UI Tests**: Create a separate test runner with full HTML structure for UI tests
4. **Integration Tests**: Run integration tests in the full game environment rather than isolated test runner
