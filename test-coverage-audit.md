# Test Coverage Audit for Architecture Classes

## Summary
Based on the PlantUML architecture diagram, here's the test coverage status for each class:

| CampaignInterface | ❌ No | - | **MISSING** |
| CampaignSystem | ❌ No | - | **MISSING** |

## Utility Services (2 classes)
| Class | Has Tests? | Test File | Status |
|-------|------------|-----------|---------|
| Logger | ❌ No | - | **MISSING** |

## Coverage Statistics
- **Total Classes in Diagram**: 25
- **Classes with Tests**: 19 (76%)
- **Classes Missing Tests**: 6 (24%)

## Missing Test Coverage (Priority Order)

### High Priority (Core Infrastructure)
1. **GameServices** - Central service locator, orchestrates all services
2. **ContentLoader** - Loads campaign content into game
3. **Logger** - Used by all services for debugging

### Medium Priority (Campaign System)
4. **CampaignInterface** - Validates campaign data structure
5. **CampaignSystem** - Manages campaigns and missions

### Low Priority (Main Game)
6. **CyberOpsGame** - Has basic tests but could use more comprehensive coverage

## Recommendations

1. **Create GameServices tests** - Test service initialization order and dependency injection
2. **Create ContentLoader tests** - Test campaign loading, validation, and error handling
3. **Create Logger tests** - Test log levels, filtering, and history
4. **Create Campaign system tests** - Test campaign/mission registration and retrieval
5. **Expand CyberOpsGame tests** - Test main game loop, state transitions, and rendering

## Test Files to Create
1. `tests/game-services-tests.js`
2. `tests/content-loader-tests.js`
3. `tests/logger-tests.js`
4. `tests/campaign-system-tests.js`
