# Service Integration Summary

## Completed Integration: MissionService & GameStateService

### Services Extracted and Integrated

#### 1. **MissionService** (`js/services/mission-service.js`)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Mission lifecycle management (start, complete, fail)
  - Objective tracking and completion
  - Mission timers and extraction state
  - Quest management (tracks NPC quests while NPCs manage dialog)
  - Event notifications for mission updates
  - Export/import state for saves

- **Key Features Added:**
  - Integrated quest tracking alongside mission objectives
  - Logger integration for debugging
  - Compatibility with ResourceService for rewards
  - Event system for UI updates

#### 2. **GameStateService** (`js/services/game-state-service.js`)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Centralized save/load management
  - Auto-save functionality with configurable intervals
  - State validation and versioning
  - Integration with all other services for complete state
  - Save slot management (multiple saves)

- **Key Features:**
  - Works with MissionService, ResourceService, AgentService, InventoryService
  - Automatic state collection from all services
  - Version migration support for future updates
  - Logger integration for debugging

### Integration Points

#### GameServices Class Updated
```javascript
// Added to constructor:
this.missionService = new MissionService(this.resourceService, this.agentService);
this.gameStateService = new GameStateService(
    this.resourceService,
    this.agentService,
    this.inventoryService,
    this.missionService
);
```

#### Compatibility Layer Properties Added to game-core.js
- `completedMissions` → delegates to MissionService
- `missionTrackers` → delegates to MissionService.trackers
- `extractionEnabled` → delegates to MissionService
- `currentMissionDef` → delegates to MissionService.currentMission
- `completedQuests` → delegates to MissionService

#### Save/Load Integration
- `saveToSlot()` now uses GameStateService if available
- `performLoadGame()` now uses GameStateService if available
- Auto-save initialized on game start
- Fallback to legacy system for backward compatibility

### Files Modified

1. **New Service Files:**
   - `js/services/mission-service.js` (921 lines)
   - `js/services/game-state-service.js` (635 lines)

2. **Updated Files:**
   - `js/services/game-services.js` - Added new services
   - `js/game-core.js` - Added compatibility properties and initialization
   - `js/game-saveload.js` - Integrated GameStateService
   - `index.html` - Added script tags for new services

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Centralized State Management:**
   - All mission-related operations go through MissionService
   - All save/load operations go through GameStateService
   - No more scattered mission tracking logic

2. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - Compatibility layer ensures existing code continues to work
   - Gradual migration path for remaining direct property access
   - Fallback to legacy systems if services unavailable

3. **Better Testability:**
   - Services can be tested independently
   - Mock dependencies for unit testing
   - Clear API boundaries

4. **Event-Driven Updates:**
   - Services notify listeners of state changes
   - UI can subscribe to relevant events
   - Decoupled components

### Quest System Architecture Decision

**NPCs manage quest dialog, MissionService tracks quest state**

This separation maintains clean boundaries:
- NPCs handle presentation (dialog, interactions)
- MissionService handles data (progress, completion, rewards)
- Allows different NPC systems without changing quest tracking

### Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Update Mission Start/Complete:**
   - Replace direct mission manipulation with `missionService.startMission()`
   - Use `missionService.completeMission()` for completion

2. **Update Objective Tracking:**
   - Use `missionService.trackEvent()` for enemy kills, items collected, etc.
   - Replace direct `missionTrackers` manipulation

3. **Update Quest System:**
   - Have NPCs call `missionService.registerQuest()` when giving quests
   - Use `missionService.updateQuestProgress()` for progress

4. **Enable Auto-Save:**
   - Auto-save is initialized but needs testing
   - Configure intervals via `gameStateService.autoSaveInterval`

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Mission start and complete work via service
- [ ] Objectives track correctly
- [ ] Save/load preserves all state
- [ ] Auto-save functions properly
- [ ] Quest tracking integrates with NPCs
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] No performance regressions

### Summary

Successfully extracted and integrated MissionService and GameStateService from US_ARCH_REF branch. The services are fully integrated with Logger, work with existing services, and maintain backward compatibility through property delegation. The architecture now follows the Service pattern consistently across all major game systems.
