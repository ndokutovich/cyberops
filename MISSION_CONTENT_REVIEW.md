**NPCs & Side Quests:**

#### Marcus "The Broker" Kane
*Former Nexus Corp data analyst who discovered Project Convergence and fled.*

**Greeting:**
> "You're with the Syndicate? Good. Nexus Corp needs to burn. I used to work for them - I know what they're really doing."

**Info Dialog:**
> "Project Convergence isn't just surveillance - it's an AI weapons program. Autonomous drones, robotic soldiers, all controlled by a central AI. The government is funding it secretly. I have proof, but I need your help getting more."

**Quest: Corporate Sabotage**
> *Intro:* "Nexus keeps their dirty secrets spread across multiple terminals. Hack 3 of them and I can piece together the full picture of Project Convergence. This will give us leverage against them."
>
> *Complete:* "Excellent! This data confirms government funding for Convergence. I'll leak this to our contacts - it'll make their London facility very nervous. Here's your payment."
>
> *Reward:* 500 credits, 10 RP, 150 XP

**Quest: Intelligence Gathering**
> *Intro:* "There's a classified file called 'CONVERGENCE-ALPHA' somewhere in their mainframe. It contains the location of their main research facility. Get it, and we'll know exactly where to hit them."
>
> *Complete:* "This is it! The facility is in Singapore. Heavily fortified, but now we know where to look. The Syndicate will want to see this."
>
> *Reward:* 750 credits, keycard, 200 XP

#### Jim "Wrench" Wilson
*Building maintenance worker whose brother was taken as a Nexus test subject.*

**Greeting:**
> "Hey, you're not with Nexus, are you? Good. Those bastards took my brother for their 'experiments.' I want to help you hurt them."

**Info Dialog:**
> "They said it was a 'medical trial.' He went into that Singapore facility and never came out. I've been looking for proof ever since. If you find anything about test subjects... let me know."

**Quest: Secret Passage**
> *Intro:* "Listen, there's a maintenance tunnel the guards don't know about. It leads to a storage area where Nexus stashes... things. Evidence, maybe. I marked it on your map. Be careful - and if you find anything about test subjects, I need to know."
>
> *Complete:* "You made it! Did you find anything about the experiments? ...No? Well, maybe the Singapore facility will have answers. Here, take this for your trouble."
>
> *Reward:* 300 credits, 100 XP

#### Viktor "The Fence" Kozlov
*Arms dealer whose family was ruined by Nexus Corp.*

**Greeting:**
> "Syndicate, yes? I heard you're hitting Nexus Corp. Good. They ruined my family. Now I arm their enemies. Looking to buy or sell?"

**Info Dialog:**
> "Nexus Corp? They control half the city through fear and money. But you're hurting them - I can see it in their supply lines. They're buying more weapons, hiring more guards. That means they're scared. Keep pushing. I'll make sure you have the firepower you need. Discount for Syndicate operatives."

### Mission 1-002: Network Breach

**Title:** Government Facility
**Location:** London, Europe
**Map Type:** Government Research Facility (90x70)

**Briefing:**
> The intel from Nexus Corp was worse than we feared. They're not working alone - we found evidence of massive government funding flowing into something called "Project Convergence." This London facility is where the money trail leads. Break into their network and find out what Nexus is really building with taxpayer money. Be careful - government security is even tighter than corporate.

**Story Context:**
> The conspiracy deepens. Nexus Corp has powerful allies in government who are funding their secret weapons research.

**Description:**
> Infiltrate the government research facility funding Nexus Corp's weapons program.

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Hack 3 terminals** (REQUIRED)
2. **Extract data** (REQUIRED) - Reach extraction after hacking
3. **Avoid civilian casualties** (OPTIONAL)
4. **Keep at least 2 agents alive** (OPTIONAL)

**Enemies:** 8 (guards, soldiers, heavy)

**Rewards:** 2,500 credits | 75 RP

---

**NPCs & Side Quests:**

#### Zero Cool
*Legendary hacker who discovered the government-Nexus funding connection.*

**Greeting:**
> "Syndicate operatives? Perfect timing. I've been waiting for someone capable to show up. This facility is the money pipeline - government funds flowing straight to Nexus."

**Info Dialog:**
> "Project Convergence is being funded through this facility. Black budget, completely off the books. Billions flowing to Nexus Corp for 'defense research.' If we crash their network, it'll delay the money transfer and buy us time."

**Quest: Network Sabotage**
> *Intro:* "I've written a virus that will corrupt their financial systems and expose the money trail. Upload it to any terminal and the whole world will see where their tax money is really going. This will hurt Nexus where it counts - their wallet."
>
> *Complete:* "Beautiful! Their network is crashing and the transaction logs are being leaked to every news outlet. Nexus Corp is about to have some very uncomfortable questions to answer. Here's your cut."
>
> *Reward:* 600 credits, 15 RP, 175 XP

### Mission 1-003: Industrial Sabotage

**Title:** Sabotage Operation
**Location:** Tokyo, Asia
**Map Type:** Industrial Complex (100x80)

**Briefing:**
> We've traced Project Convergence to its source - this industrial complex in Tokyo. It's registered as an independent arms manufacturer, but it's actually a Nexus Corp shell company. This is where they're building the AI-controlled weapons the government is funding. We can't let this continue. Plant explosives at the production lines and destroy their manufacturing capability. Dr. Chen, a former Nexus engineer, is inside and willing to help - she knows where to hit them hardest.

**Story Context:**
> Time to strike back. Destroying this facility will cripple Nexus Corp's weapons production.

**Description:**
> Destroy Nexus Corp's secret weapons manufacturing facility in Tokyo.

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Plant explosives at production lines** (REQUIRED) - 3 explosives
2. **Survive until explosives detonate** (REQUIRED) - 60 seconds
3. **Avoid civilian casualties** (OPTIONAL)

**NPCs & Side Quests:**

#### Dr. Sarah Chen
*Former lead engineer on Project Convergence, consumed by guilt for what she helped create.*

**Greeting:**
> "I designed the weapons they're building here. The autonomous targeting systems, the AI cores... I didn't know what they were for. When I found out about the human trials, I tried to quit. They said I knew too much."

**Info Dialog:**
> "Convergence is an AI that controls autonomous weapons - drones, robots, even hijacked vehicles. It learns from combat data. The more it fights, the smarter it gets. And the human trials... they're testing neural interfaces. Making people into weapons. I have to stop what I started."

**Quest: Sabotage Plan**
> *Intro:* "I know every weakness in this facility - I designed half of it. The production lines have critical failure points. Place explosives at these exact coordinates and the entire factory will be inoperable for months. It won't stop Convergence, but it'll slow them down."
>
> *Complete:* "The chain reaction is starting. This factory is finished. But the main AI is in Singapore - that's where you need to go next. Destroy Convergence before it goes online. Please... fix my mistake."
>
> *Reward:* 800 credits, 250 XP

This is a pure reconnaissance mission: infiltrate the compound, hack their terminals for intel on Project Convergence, and get out without being detected. If they know we're coming, they'll move everything. Stealth is paramount - one alarm and the mission fails.

**Story Context:**

### Mission 2-001: Assassination Contract

**Title:** Slums Extraction
**Location:** Manila, Asia
**Map Type:** Slums District (90x60)

**Briefing:**
> The recon data revealed something disturbing - Nexus Corp uses local crime syndicates as muscle and recruitment pools for their private army. This slums district in Manila is controlled by one such syndicate. Their boss and lieutenants are on Nexus payroll, kidnapping people for "test subjects." We're putting an end to this. Eliminate the crime boss and his lieutenants, but avoid harming civilians - they're victims here, not enemies.

Our recon shows they're days away from activation. We've crippled their manufacturing, exposed their government allies, and eliminated their criminal network. Now we end this. Breach the outer defenses, fight through their security forces, and capture the mainframe. Once we have control, we can shut down Convergence permanently. The fate of millions depends on what happens in the next hour. Good luck, operatives.
