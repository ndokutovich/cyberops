Black sites. Missing scientists.
Massive government contracts that don't exist on any public record."

biometric locks on every door."

**HANDLER:** "Your objective: reach the mainframe on floor 47.
Download everything. We need proof of what they're hiding."

*Team Discussion*

do what you have to do."

Armed response teams on standby.
If the alarm triggers, you'll have
two minutes before the building locks down."

*Mission briefing*

Once people see where their taxes go..."

The brain... the real weapon..."

That's where Convergence lives.
That's where they're testing it on... on people."

Convergence goes online in seventy-two hours.
Once it activates, those people become
the first wave of its army."

**HANDLER:** "Not quite. First we need to cut off their
support network. Their enforcers."

every mercenary, every criminal organization
they can find to protect that facility."

**HANDLER:** "The Ortega Syndicate. Manila's most
ruthless crime family. They've been
kidnapping people for Nexus's experiments
for years. Getting rich off human misery."

**HANDLER:** "Once we take them down, Nexus loses
their last shield. Then there's nothing
between us and Convergence."

Singapore facility and never return."
