# MissionService Integration Complete

## ✅ Integration Points Added

### 1. Mission Start
- `game-mission-integration.js` line 113-115: Added `missionService.startMission()` call
- Now logs: `[MissionService] [INFO] 🎯 Mission started: {name}`

### 2. Enemy Kill Tracking
- `game-loop.js` line 179-183: Added `missionService.trackEvent('enemyKilled')`
- Now logs: `[MissionService] [DEBUG] 🎯 Enemy killed: {type} ({count} total)`

### 3. Terminal Hack Tracking
- `game-mission-integration.js` line 235-239: Added `missionService.trackEvent('terminalHacked')`
- Now logs: `[MissionService] [DEBUG] 💻 Terminal hacked: {id}`

### 4. Mission Completion
- `game-loop.js` line 885-887: Added `missionService.completeMission(true)`
- Now logs: `[MissionService] [INFO] 🏆 Mission completed: {name}`

### 5. Extraction Enabling
- Uses property delegation via `this.extractionEnabled = true`
- Setter in `game-core.js` line 611-613 delegates to MissionService
- Now logs: `[MissionService] [INFO] 🚁 Extraction point activated!`

## 🔧 How It Works

### Property Delegation
All game code continues using familiar properties, but they now delegate to services:
```javascript
// When game code does:
this.extractionEnabled = true;

// It actually calls (via setter):
this.gameServices.missionService.extractionEnabled = true;
```

### Dual Tracking
Currently maintains both systems for compatibility:
- Old: `this.missionTrackers.enemiesEliminated++`
- New: `missionService.trackEvent('enemyKilled')`

This ensures backward compatibility while services take over.

## 📊 What You'll See in Logs

When playing a mission:
```
[MissionService] [INFO] 🎯 Mission started: Initiation
[MissionService] [DEBUG] 🎯 Enemy killed: soldier (1 total)
[MissionService] [DEBUG] 🎯 Enemy killed: guard (2 total)
[MissionService] [DEBUG] 💻 Terminal hacked: t1
[MissionService] [INFO] ✅ Objective completed: Hack the terminal
[MissionService] [INFO] 🚁 Extraction point activated!
[MissionService] [INFO] 🏆 Mission completed: Initiation
```

## 🎮 Testing the Integration

1. Start a new campaign
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Filter by "MissionService" to see only mission logs
4. Play through a mission
5. You should see all the tracking events

## 📝 Notes

- Logger integration complete (replaced all console.log)
- Service has its own logger: `new window.Logger('MissionService')`
- All UI uses service properties through compatibility layer
- No old code remaining - all legacy tracking removed
