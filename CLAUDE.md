# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

CyberOps: Syndicate is a browser-based cyberpunk tactical game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Three.js for 3D rendering. The game features isometric tactical combat, resource management, and a strategic campaign system.

## Architecture

The game uses a modular JavaScript architecture with the main `CyberOpsGame` class split across multiple files for better organization. All functionality remains exactly the same, just divided into logical modules:

### JavaScript Modules (js/ directory)
- **game-core.js**: Core constructor and initialization
- **game-events.js**: Event handlers and input management
- **game-flow.js**: Game flow, missions, and abilities

- **Objective Tracking**: Real-time mission progress with extraction point activation

## Running the Game

The game is a standalone HTML file that can be opened directly in a browser. No build process or server required.

```bash
# Simply open the HTML file in a browser
# Or use a local server for better performance:
python -m http.server 8000
# Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/cyberops-game.html
```

## Important Implementation Details

### Canvas and Camera System
- The game uses HTML5 Canvas 2D context for primary rendering
- Isometric projection with configurable tile dimensions (64x32 default)
- Camera position stored in `cameraX`, `cameraY` with zoom support
- Canvas automatically resizes to window dimensions

### Agent Selection Protection
- The game implements selection protection (`selectionProtection` flag) to prevent accidental deselection during gameplay
- Selected agent tracked via `_selectedAgent` with getter/setter pattern

### Audio Initialization
- Audio requires user interaction to enable (click/touch)
- Multiple audio tracks for different levels and screens
- Music files (.mp3/.wav) are gitignored but expected to exist

### 3D System Integration (Three.js r180)
- Three.js r180 loaded as ES6 module and exposed globally via lib/three-loader.js
- Module files in lib/ directory: three.module.min.js and three.core.min.js (dependencies)
- 3D mode toggleable with E key, cycles through camera modes:
  - Tactical (2D): Standard isometric view
  - Isometric (3D): Bird's eye 3D view
  - Third-person: Behind selected agent
  - First-person: From agent's perspective
- 3D container (#game3DContainer) overlays the 2D canvas when active
- WebGL renderer with shadows, frustum culling for performance
- Uses CapsuleGeometry for agents (requires Three.js r152+)
- 3D world created once per mission, not recreated on camera switches
- Separate HUD for 3D mode with crosshair and mode indicator

### Game State Persistence
- Mission progress tracked in `completedMissions` array
- Resource state (credits, research points) maintained across missions
- Auto-save system with pre-mission saves for retry functionality
- Manual save/load functionality with multiple save slots

## Recent Features and Approaches

### NPC System (game-npc.js)
- **Dialog System**: HTML-based dialog boxes with typing animation effect
- **Quest System**: Side quests with objectives, rewards, and completion tracking
- **Context-Sensitive Actions**: NPCs offer different options based on nearby objects (terminals, enemies)
- **3D Integration**: NPCs render in both 2D and 3D modes with interaction indicators
- **Coordinate System**: NPCs use world coordinates, properly converted for screen rendering

### Keyboard Handling (game-keyboard.js)
- **Centralized Bindings**: All keyboard shortcuts in one place for easy modification
- **Key Features**:
  - H: Interact with NPCs or hack
  - Z: Cycle game speed (1x/2x/4x)
  - J: Show comprehensive mission list
  - E: Toggle 3D modes (tactical/third/first person)
  - Tab: Cycle through agents
  - 1-6: Direct agent selection

### Mission List System
- **Comprehensive Overview**: Shows primary objectives and all side quests
- **Quest Tracking**: Visual indicators for quest progress and completion
- **Statistics**: Tracks terminals hacked, enemies eliminated, credits earned
- **Rewards Display**: Shows potential rewards for completing quests

### UI/UX Improvements
- **HUD Dialog System**: Consistent dialog styling across all screens
- **Hall of Glory**: Memorial for fallen agents with cyberpunk aesthetic
- **Speed Indicator**: Visual feedback for current game speed
- **Quest HUD**: Active quests displayed on-screen during gameplay
- **Health Bars**: Fixed display for dead agents and text wrapping

## Campaign and Mission Architecture

### Complete Separation of Engine and Content
The game achieves "3rd normal form" - the engine knows NOTHING about specific campaigns or missions. All content is loaded dynamically from external campaign files.

### Campaign System
- **Campaign Files**: Each campaign is a directory with acts and missions
- **Mission Files**: Self-contained JavaScript files with embedded maps
- **Dynamic Loading**: `game-campaign-integration.js` loads campaigns at runtime
- **No Hardcoded Content**: Engine contains zero mission-specific code

### Campaign Loading Process
1. **HTML loads**: cyberops-game.html includes game-campaign-integration.js
2. **Campaign auto-registers**: Each mission file self-registers with CampaignSystem
3. **Mission selection**: Player selects from available missions in hub
4. **Dynamic loading**: Mission data loaded at runtime, including embedded map
5. **NPC spawning**: NPCs loaded from mission definition, not hardcoded

### Mission File Structure
Each mission file (e.g., `campaigns/main/act1/main-01-001.js`) is self-contained:
```javascript
(function() {
    const mission = {
        id: 'main-01-001',
        campaign: 'main',
        act: 1,
        map: {
            embedded: {
                tiles: [
                    "################...", // String array, one per row
                    "################...", // Each string = map width chars
                ],
                spawn: { x: 2, y: 78 },
                extraction: { x: 78, y: 2 },
                terminals: [...],
                doors: [...],
                npcs: [...]
            }
        },
        objectives: [...],
        rewards: { credits: 2000, researchPoints: 50 }
    };

    // Self-registration
    CampaignSystem.registerMission('main', 1, 'main-01-001', mission);
})();
```

### Declarative Mission Design
- **OBJECTIVE_TYPES**: Interact, Eliminate, Collect, Reach, Survive, Custom
- **INTERACTION_TARGETS**: Terminal, Explosive, Switch, Gate, Door, NPC

### Mission Flow
1. Mission loads from JSON definition
2. Map generates from declarative data (preserving original layouts)
3. Objectives tracked via `missionTrackers` counters
4. Extraction enables when all required objectives complete
5. Mission completes when agents reach extraction point

### Special Interactions
All interactions use the H key with context-sensitive behavior:
- **Terminals**: Hack to unlock doors or complete objectives
- **Explosives**: Plant bombs at designated targets (Mission 3)
- **Switches**: Activate to disable alarms or systems
- **Gates**: Breach fortified entrances (Mission 5)
- **NPCs**: Engage in dialog and receive quests

### Mission Integration
- `game-mission-executor.js`: Generic objective checking, no hardcoded logic
- `game-mission-integration.js`: Bridges new system with legacy code
- `useActionAbility()`: Universal interaction handler
- Fallback system allows interactions even when not mission objectives

### Map System
- **Embedded Maps Only**: All maps are embedded in mission files as string arrays
- **String-Based Format**: Each tile row is a string, '#' for walls, '.' for floors
- **Efficient Storage**: ~150 lines per mission vs 14,000+ lines in old format
- **Map Dimensions**: Corporate (80x80), Government (90x70), Industrial (100x80), etc.
- **NO Procedural Generation**: All procedural generation code completely removed

## Critical Architecture Principles

### Boy Scout Rule - Leave Code Cleaner Than You Found It
- **ALWAYS** clean up unused code when you encounter it
- **ALWAYS** remove commented-out code unless it has a TODO explanation
- **ALWAYS** fix inconsistencies in formatting when editing a file
- **ALWAYS** remove unused imports, variables, and functions
- **ALWAYS** update related documentation when changing code
- **NEVER** leave behind test code, console.logs (unless for errors), or temporary hacks

### NEVER Use Old Approaches
- **NEVER** create procedural map generation - all maps are embedded
- **NEVER** hardcode mission data in engine files
- **NEVER** put NPCs, quests, or content in engine code
- **NEVER** use browser-based tools for data conversion - use Node.js
- **NEVER** leave unused generation code in mission files
- **ALWAYS** keep complete separation between engine and content
- **ALWAYS** use campaign files for all mission-specific content

### Content Location Rules
- **Mission Content**: ONLY in `campaigns/*/act*/mission.js` files
- **Engine Code**: ONLY generic systems in `js/game-*.js` files
- **NPCs and Quests**: ONLY in mission definition files
- **Maps**: ONLY as embedded string arrays in mission files

## Major Cleanup Process Completed

### What Was Removed
1. **Procedural Map Generation**: 973 lines reduced to 22-line stub
2. **Hardcoded NPCs**: 400+ lines of NPCs removed from game-npc.js
3. **Hardcoded Missions**: All mission data moved to campaign files
4. **game-maps-data.js**: Completely deleted (was 14,000+ lines)
5. **game-missions-data.js**: Completely deleted
6. **Intermediate Tools**: All test HTML files and conversion scripts removed

### Storage Efficiency Achieved
- **Old Format**: 14,000+ lines per mission (object per tile)
- **New Format**: ~150 lines per mission (string arrays)
- **Reduction**: 99% smaller file sizes

### Why This Architecture
- **3rd Normal Form**: Complete separation like database normalization
- **Engine Independence**: Engine can run ANY campaign without modification
- **Content Portability**: Campaigns are self-contained modules
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Smaller files, faster loading

## Mission Editor System

The mission editor (`mission-editor.html` and `mission-editor.js`) provides comprehensive campaign management and map editing capabilities.

### Campaign Management Features
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete for all campaign content types
- **IndexedDB Persistence**: Campaigns stored in browser storage for seamless switching
- **Import/Export**: Support for ZIP archives and directory imports
- **Mission Reordering**: Visual up/down arrows and dedicated reorder dialog
- **Act Management**: Create/delete acts with descriptive titles (Beginning Operations, Escalation, etc.)

### Key Implementation Details
- **Unified Mission Loading**: Single flow whether selecting from dropdown or clicking Map Editor button
- **Mission Dropdown**: Shows current mission in caption ("Current: Mission Name")
- **Auto-refresh**: Mission list updates automatically after any CRUD operation
- **Visual Feedback**: Green notification slides when mission loads, dialog auto-closes

### Campaign Storage Architecture
1. **Loading Priority** (in order):
   - IndexedDB (last saved campaign)
   - Window.MAIN_CAMPAIGN_CONTENT (from code)
   - Default campaign creation
2. **Mission Sync**: Missions from CAMPAIGN_MISSIONS merged into campaign.missions array
3. **Persistence**: All changes saved to IndexedDB automatically

### Mission Structure Requirements
New missions created via editor include:
- **Embedded map data**: 40x40 starter map with walls
- **Proper ID format**: `campaign-act-mission` (e.g., main-01-003)
- **Complete map object**: tiles, spawn, extraction, terminals, etc.
- **Default objectives**: At least one objective for valid mission

## Lessons Learned from Development

### 1. Async/Await Consistency
**Issue**: Mixed callback and async patterns causing timing issues
**Solution**: Use async/await throughout, mark all async functions properly
```javascript
// Bad
function saveCampaign() {
    this.saveCampaignToDB(campaign);
}

// Good
async saveCampaign() {
    await this.saveCampaignToDB(campaign);
}
```

### 2. Global State Synchronization
**Issue**: CAMPAIGN_MISSIONS and campaign.missions getting out of sync
**Solution**: Always sync both directions with explicit sync functions
```javascript
syncMissionsToGlobal() {
    window.CAMPAIGN_MISSIONS = {};
    this.currentCampaign.missions.forEach(m => {
        window.CAMPAIGN_MISSIONS[m.id] = m;
    });
}
```

### 3. UI State Management
**Issue**: Dropdown selections resetting after operations
**Solution**: Preserve selection state, update caption to show current selection

### 4. Data Structure Consistency
**Issue**: Missions without required embedded map data couldn't load
**Solution**: Always create complete data structures, even with defaults

### 5. Event Handler Cleanup
**Issue**: Memory leaks from duplicate event listeners
**Solution**: Check for existing elements/listeners before adding new ones

### 6. Visual Feedback Importance
**Issue**: Users uncertain if operations completed
**Solution**: Add notifications, loading states, and success confirmations

## Development Best Practices

### Tooling and Automation
- **Use Node.js for intermediate tasks**: When generating data, converting formats, or performing batch operations, use Node.js scripts rather than browser-based tools or manual copy-paste approaches
- **Keep the app as HTML SPA**: The game itself should remain a simple HTML single-page application without any Node.js build process or dependencies
- **Examples of Node.js tasks**: Map generation, batch file updates, data conversion, validation scripts

### Module Pattern
- Use prototype-based inheritance, NOT ES6 classes
- Functions attached to `CyberOpsGame.prototype`
- Example: `CyberOpsGame.prototype.functionName = function() { }`

### Coordinate Systems
- **World Coordinates**: Used for game logic (agents, NPCs, enemies)
- **Screen Coordinates**: Converted using `worldToIsometric()` for rendering
- **3D Coordinates**: Converted with map offset calculations for Three.js

### Error Handling
- Always check if functions exist before calling (e.g., `if (this.updateNPCs)`)
- Use safety checks for optional systems
- Provide fallbacks for missing features

### Debugging
- Console logging for major events with emojis for easy identification
- Debug flags for pathfinding, vision cones, etc.
- Comprehensive error messages with context
- Check console for mission system initialization messages

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Method Name Typos
**Never** assume method names - always verify:
- `saveCampaignToDB()` not `saveCampaign()`
- `refreshMissionList()` not `refresh()` or `update()`

### 2. Missing Async/Await
**Always** check if a function is async before calling:
```javascript
// Will cause errors if function is async
this.saveCampaignToDB(campaign);

// Correct
await this.saveCampaignToDB(campaign);
```

### 3. State Synchronization
**Always** update all related state when making changes:
- Update both `campaign.missions` AND `window.CAMPAIGN_MISSIONS`
- Refresh UI components after data changes
- Save to IndexedDB after modifications

### 4. Initialization Timing
**Never** assume components are ready:
```javascript
// Bad - may not be initialized
campaignManager.loadMissions();

// Good - check initialization
if (campaignManager && campaignManager.isInitialized) {
    campaignManager.loadMissions();
}
```

### 5. UI Refresh Patterns
**Always** refresh UI after data operations:
- `loadMissions()` - refresh missions tab
- `refreshMissionList()` - refresh dropdown
- `saveCampaignToDB()` - persist changes

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 3D Mode Issues
- **3D Mode Not Working (E key)**:
  - Check console for "✅ Three.js r180 loaded!"
  - Ensure three.module.min.js and three.core.min.js are in lib/ directory
  - Container must have non-zero dimensions and proper z-index
  - Renderer alpha should be false for proper background rendering
- **3D World Not Visible**:
  - Check "🎨 Rendering 3D" logs for scene children count
  - Verify container3D display is "block" when 3D enabled
  - Canvas element needs absolute positioning within container
- **Performance Issues in 3D**:
  - Frustum culling automatically hides off-screen objects
  - Pixel ratio limited to 2 for high-DPI displays
  - Consider reducing shadow map size if needed

### Mission System Issues
- **Extraction Not Working**: Check if `extractionEnabled = true` when objectives complete
- **Objectives Not Tracking**: Verify `missionTrackers.enemiesEliminated` increments
- **H Key Not Working**: Ensure `useActionAbility()` exists and checks all interaction types
- **Mission Not Loading**: Check console for "Setting currentMissionDef" message

### Integration Checks
- **Script Order**: Campaign integration → Mission executor → Mission integration
- **Campaign Loading**: Campaigns load from `campaigns/` directory at runtime
- **Constants**: OBJECTIVE_TYPES and INTERACTION_TARGETS must be defined
- **Initialization**: `initMissions()` called during game startup
- **Game Loop**: `updateMissionObjectives()` runs every frame

### Working with Missions
- **To modify a mission**: Edit the corresponding file in `campaigns/main/act*/`
- **To add items**: Add to the `embedded` section of the mission file
- **To add NPCs**: Add to the `npcs` array with spawn location and quests
- **To change map**: Edit the `tiles` string array (keep width consistent!)
- **Map characters**: '#' = wall, '.' = floor, other chars for special tiles

## Declarative Configuration Systems

The game uses comprehensive declarative configurations for all dynamic content, allowing modification without code changes.

### Audio Configuration (game-music-config.js)

#### Global Audio Settings
```javascript
global: {
    masterVolume: 1.0,
    musicVolume: 0.7,
    sfxVolume: 0.8,
    fadeInTime: 2000,
    fadeOutTime: 1000,
    crossfadeTime: 1500
}
```

#### Screen Music Configuration
Each screen can have multiple tracks with transitions. The music system uses intelligent continuation and conditional timing:

**Critical Music Flow Behavior:**
1. **Splash Screen**: Plays `game-music.mp3` from 0 seconds
2. **Menu Screen**:
   - If splash was SKIPPED → starts at 10.6 seconds (skips intro)
   - If splash NOT skipped → continues naturally from where splash left off
3. **Hub Screen**: Continues same music track without restart (type: 'continue')

```javascript
screens: {
    splash: {
        tracks: {
            main: {
                file: 'game-music.mp3',
                fallback: 'music/global/menu.mp3',
                volume: 0.5,
                loop: true,
                fadeIn: 1000,
                startTime: 0  // Always start from beginning
            }
        },
        events: [{
            id: 'skip',
            trigger: 'user_input',
            action: 'transitionToMenu',
            markSkipped: true  // Sets splashSkipped flag
        }],
        transitions: {
            toMenu: { type: 'continue' }  // Music continues, doesn't restart
        }
    },
    menu: {
        tracks: {
            main: {
                file: 'game-music.mp3',  // Same file as splash
                volume: 0.6,
                loop: true,
                fadeIn: 2000,
                startTime: 10.6,  // Skip intro if splash was skipped
                startTimeCondition: 'splashSkipped'  // ONLY use startTime if condition met
            }
        },
        transitions: {
            toHub: {
                type: 'continue',  // Continue same music
                volumeAdjust: 0.8  // Reduce volume in hub
            }
        }
    },
    hub: {
        tracks: {
            ambient: {  // Note: 'ambient' not 'main' for hub
                file: 'game-music.mp3',
                volume: 0.5,
                loop: true,
                fadeIn: 1500
                // No startTime - continues from current position
            },
            alert: {  // Secondary track for special events
                file: 'music/screens/hub-alert.mp3',
                volume: 0.7,
                loop: false,
                priority: 2,
                trigger: 'low_resources'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Important Implementation Notes:**
- Campaign music config MUST match this exact structure with `tracks` wrapper
- The `startTimeCondition` is critical for proper skip behavior
- Hub uses `ambient` track name, not `main`
- All screens use same `game-music.mp3` for seamless transitions
- Transition `type: 'continue'` prevents music restart between screens

#### Mission Music Configuration
Dynamic multi-track system with state-based switching:
```javascript
missions: {
    default: {
        ambient: { file: 'ambient.mp3', volume: 0.6, loop: true },
        combat: { file: 'combat.mp3', volume: 0.8, priority: 2 },
        stealth: { file: 'stealth.mp3', volume: 0.4, priority: 1 },
        alert: { file: 'alert.mp3', volume: 0.7, priority: 3 },
        victory: { file: 'victory.mp3', volume: 0.8, priority: 10 }
    }
}
```

#### Sound Effects Configuration
Comprehensive SFX with fallback chain:
```javascript
soundEffects: {
    combat: {
        shoot: {
            file: 'sfx-shoot.wav',      // Primary file
            fallback: 'sfx-shoot.mp3',  // Secondary fallback
            procedural: true,            // Generate if files missing
            volume: 0.5,
            variations: ['sfx-shoot-1.wav', 'sfx-shoot-2.wav']
        }
    }
}
```

#### Contextual Sound System
Environment and state-based modifications:
```javascript
contextualSounds: {
    environments: {
        industrial: {
            footstep: { volume: 0.3, reverb: 0.7 },
            shoot: { volume: 0.6, echo: true }
        }
    },
    states: {
        stealth: { volumeMultiplier: 0.5 },
        combat: { volumeMultiplier: 1.2 },
        critical: { hit: { volume: 0.8, vibration: [100] } }
    }
}
```

#### Procedural Sound Templates
ADSR synthesis for missing files:
```javascript
proceduralSettings: {
    templates: {
        explosion: {
            waveform: 'noise',
            frequency: 50,
            duration: 500,
            envelope: {
                attack: 0,
                decay: 100,
                sustain: 200,

### Campaign Configuration (campaigns/*/)

#### Campaign Structure
```
campaigns/
├── main/           # Main campaign
│   ├── act1/       # Act 1 missions
│   │   ├── main-01-001.js

│   │   └── main-02-002.js
│   └── campaign.json  # Campaign metadata
```

#### Mission Configuration
Each mission is self-contained with embedded map:
```javascript
{
    id: 'main-01-001',
    name: 'Initiation',
    briefing: 'Infiltrate the corporate facility...',
    map: {
        embedded: {
            tiles: [  // String array, one row per string
                "########...",
                "#......#..."
            ],
            spawn: { x: 2, y: 78 },
            extraction: { x: 78, y: 2 },
            terminals: [
                { x: 10, y: 20, id: 't1', hackTime: 3000 }
            ],
            doors: [
                { x: 15, y: 25, locked: true, linkedTerminal: 't1' }
            ],
            npcs: [
                {
                    id: 'informant',
                    x: 20, y: 30,
                    name: 'Ghost',
                    quests: [...]
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    objectives: [
        {
            id: 'eliminate_targets',
            type: 'eliminate',
            description: 'Eliminate all enemies',
            target: { type: 'enemy', count: 8 },
            required: true
        }
    ],
    rewards: {
        credits: 2000,
        researchPoints: 50,
        worldControl: 1
    }
}
```

### Visual Effects Configuration (Planned)

#### Screen Shake Effects
```javascript
visualEffects: {
    screenShake: {
        explosion: {
            intensity: 10,
            duration: 500,
            falloff: 'exponential'
        },
        hit: {
            intensity: 3,
            duration: 200,
            falloff: 'linear'
        }
    },
    freeze: {
        victory: { duration: 1000 },
        defeat: { duration: 2000 }
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Declarative Configuration

1. **No Code Changes Required**: Modify game behavior through JSON
2. **Centralized Management**: All configs in dedicated files
3. **Version Control Friendly**: Track config changes separately
4. **Modding Support**: Easy for users to customize
5. **Validation**: Configs can be validated against schemas
6. **Hot Reloading**: Potential for runtime config updates
7. **A/B Testing**: Easy to swap configurations
8. **Documentation**: Self-documenting structure

## Coordinate Systems and Camera Transforms

### Critical Insight: Turn-Based Overlay Rendering

The turn-based overlay rendering requires special attention to coordinate transforms:

#### The Problem
```javascript
// In game-rendering.js render():
ctx.save();
ctx.translate(this.cameraX, this.cameraY);  // Apply camera transform
// ... render game world ...
ctx.restore();  // Remove camera transform

// Then AFTER restore:
if (this.turnBasedMode && this.renderTurnBasedOverlay) {
    this.renderTurnBasedOverlay();  // Called WITHOUT camera transform!
}
```

#### The Solution
When rendering overlays AFTER `ctx.restore()`, you must ADD camera offset, not subtract:

```javascript
// WRONG - This assumes camera transform is active:
const iso = this.worldToIsometric(tile.x, tile.y);
const screenX = iso.x - this.cameraX;  // ❌ Subtracting camera
const screenY = iso.y - this.cameraY;

// CORRECT - Add camera to position correctly in screen space:
const iso = this.worldToIsometric(tile.x, tile.y);
const screenX = iso.x + this.cameraX;  // ✅ Adding camera
const screenY = iso.y + this.cameraY;
```

#### Key Coordinate Systems

1. **World Coordinates**: Game logic coordinates (agents, enemies, tiles)
2. **Isometric Coordinates**: World converted to isometric screen space (no camera)
3. **Screen Coordinates**: Final pixel positions after camera transform

#### Conversion Functions

- `worldToIsometric(x, y)`: Converts world to isometric (no camera)
- `screenToIsometric(x, y)`: Converts screen pixels to isometric
- `screenToWorld(x, y)`: Full conversion from screen to world (includes camera)

#### Debugging Tips

If overlays appear at wrong positions:
1. Check if rendering happens before or after `ctx.restore()`
2. If after restore, ADD camera offset instead of subtracting
3. Verify click detection uses same coordinate system as rendering
4. Test with visible debug rectangles at known positions
