  Minimum_Damage = 1 (always)

  Enemy AI States:

  ‚úÖ SOLID ARCHITECTURE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

  I've successfully extracted all research and weapon math into a dedicated service layer following SOLID
  principles:

  üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW:

  1. FormulaService (Single Responsibility)

  - Purpose: Centralized game mathematics
  - Responsibilities:
    - Damage calculations (with armor, criticals, cover)
    - Vision and detection ranges
    - Movement costs and speed
    - Health and healing
    - Combat mechanics (hit chance, shield absorption)
    - Hacking calculations
    - Mission rewards

  2. ResearchService (Open/Closed)

  - Purpose: Research system management
  - Responsibilities:
    - Project definitions and costs
    - Research effects application
    - Progress tracking
    - Recommendations engine
    - Medical healing between missions

  3. EquipmentService (Interface Segregation)

  - Purpose: Weapon and equipment management
  - Responsibilities:
    - Weapon/equipment definitions
    - Best weapon selection
    - Equipment stacking calculations
    - Loadout recommendations by specialization
    - Effectiveness scoring

  4. GameServices (Dependency Injection)

  - Purpose: Service locator and orchestrator
  - Responsibilities:
    - Service initialization
    - Combined calculations
    - State validation
    - Recommendations engine

  üéØ KEY BENEFITS:

  1. Separation of Concerns
    - Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility
    - Math logic separated from game logic
  2. Testability
    - Each service can be unit tested independently
    - Mock dependencies easily
  3. Maintainability
    - Changes to formulas don't affect game code
    - Easy to add new research/equipment
  4. Extensibility
    - Open for extension (new formulas)
    - Closed for modification (existing code stable)
  5. Reusability
    - Services can be used anywhere in the game
    - Consistent calculations throughout

  üìä USAGE EXAMPLE:

  // Old way (scattered calculations):
  agent.damage = baseData.damage + 5; // Research hardcoded
  agent.damage += weapon.damage; // Equipment hardcoded

  // New way (centralized services):
  const agent = GameServices.calculateAgentStats(
      baseAgent,
      completedResearch,
      weapons,
      equipment
  );

  // All calculations handled by services with proper formulas

  üîß INTEGRATION:

  - Services loaded before game scripts
  - Fallback to old system if services unavailable
  - Progressive enhancement approach
  - No breaking changes to existing code

  The system now follows SOLID principles with clean separation, dependency injection, and single responsibilities
  for each service!
