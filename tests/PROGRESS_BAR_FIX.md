# Progress Bar Real-Time Update Fix

## The Problem

Progress bar wasn't updating during test execution - it only showed final result after ALL tests completed.

**Root Cause:** JavaScript is single-threaded. When tests run in a tight loop, the browser doesn't get a chance to repaint the UI between tests.

## The Solution

**Yield to the event loop** after each progress update to allow browser repaints.

### Key Change in `test-framework.js`

```javascript
// After updating progress stats
if (this.onProgress) {
    this.onProgress({
        passed: this.stats.passed,
        total: this.stats.total,
        failed: this.stats.failed,
        currentTest: test.name,
        currentSuite: suite.name
    });

    // CRITICAL: Yield to event loop so browser can repaint UI
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Test completes** → Stats updated
2. **Progress callback fires** → UI state updated (but not painted yet)
3. **Yield to event loop** → `setTimeout(..., 0)` returns control to browser
4. **Browser repaints** → Progress bar visually updates
5. **Next test runs** → Repeat

### Additional Enhancements

#### Dynamic Color Coding
```javascript
if (progress.failed > 0) {
    progressFill.style.background = 'linear-gradient(90deg, #ff4444, #ff8844)';
} else {
    progressFill.style.background = 'linear-gradient(90deg, #00ff00, #00ffff)';
}
```

- **Green** = All tests passing ✅
- **Red** = At least one failure ❌

#### Progress Text Updates
```javascript
// During execution:
"Running: should save volume | Passed: 15/30 | Failed: 0"

// On completion:
"✅ Complete! Passed: 28/30 | Failed: 2"
```

#### Reset on Start
```javascript
progressFill.style.width = '0%';
progressFill.style.background = 'linear-gradient(90deg, #00ff00, #00ffff)';
progressText.textContent = 'Starting tests...';
```

## Visual Result

**Before:**
```
Progress: [                    ] 0%
Ready to run tests...
[... all tests run ...]
Progress: [████████████████████] 100%
Complete!
```

**After:**
```
Progress: [                    ] 0%
Starting tests...

Progress: [███                 ] 15%
Running: should save volume | Passed: 5/30 | Failed: 0

Progress: [██████              ] 30%
Running: should load settings | Passed: 10/30 | Failed: 0

Progress: [████████████████████] 100%
✅ Complete! Passed: 28/30 | Failed: 2
```

## Why `setTimeout(..., 0)` Works

```javascript
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0));
```

This doesn't actually wait 0ms. It:
1. **Pushes callback to task queue**
2. **Returns control to event loop**
3. **Browser processes render queue** (repaints UI!)
4. **Callback executes** (continues test execution)

This is the standard pattern for "yielding to the browser" in JavaScript.

## Files Modified

1. **`js/test-framework.js`** - Added event loop yield
2. **`test-runner.html`** - Enhanced progress UI with colors and completion text

## Testing

```bash
start test-runner.html

# Click "🚀 RUN ALL TESTS"
# Watch the progress bar fill in real-time!
# See test names updating live
# Bar turns red if any tests fail
```

Progress bar now updates **smoothly and visibly** as tests run! 🎉
