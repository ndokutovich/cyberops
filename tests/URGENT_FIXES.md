# URGENT FIXES - Progress Bar & Stack Trace

## Issue 1: Progress Bar NOT Updating During Tests

### What Was Wrong
Progress bar only updated at the VERY END, not during test execution.

### Root Cause
`setTimeout(..., 5)` wasn't enough. Browser needs BOTH:
1. `requestAnimationFrame()` - to schedule repaint
2. `setTimeout()` - to give it time to complete

### The Fix

**File:** `js/test-framework.js:214-218`

```javascript
// BEFORE (didn't work)
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5));

// AFTER (works!)
await new Promise(resolve => requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 10);
}));
```

This forces the browser to:
1. **requestAnimationFrame** - Schedule a repaint for next frame
2. **setTimeout(10ms)** - Wait for repaint to complete
3. **Continue** - Run next test

### Debug Output Added

Added console logs to verify callback is firing:
- `ðŸ“Š Progress initialized: X tests total`
- `ðŸ“Š Progress update: 5/30 (17%)` - Shows EVERY test
- `âœ… Progress callback attached to testFramework`

**You should see these messages DURING test execution now!**

## Issue 2: Stack Trace Always Collapsed

### What Was Wrong
Stack traces in error details had:
```html
<details>
    <summary>(click to expand)</summary>
    ...
</details>
```

User had to click to see stack trace.

### The Fix

**File:** `test-runner.html:883-886`

```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<details style="...">
    <summary>Stack Trace (click to expand)</summary>

<!-- AFTER -->
<details open style="...">
    <summary>Stack Trace</summary>
```

Changes:
1. âœ… Added `open` attribute - always expanded by default
2. âœ… Removed "(click to expand)" text - no longer needed

---

## Testing Instructions

```bash
start test-runner.html

# Click "ðŸš€ RUN ALL TESTS"

# Watch console for:
âœ… Progress callback attached to testFramework
ðŸ“Š Progress initialized: 30 tests total
ðŸ“Š Progress update: 1/30 (3%)
ðŸ“Š Progress update: 2/30 (7%)
ðŸ“Š Progress update: 3/30 (10%)
... (should see update for EVERY test)
```

**Expected Result:**
1. âœ… Progress bar moves smoothly during execution
2. âœ… Console shows "ðŸ“Š Progress update" for every test
3. âœ… Stack traces are expanded by default in error reports
4. âœ… Test name updates in real-time: "Running: [test name]"

## If Progress Bar Still Doesn't Work

Check browser console for:
- `âœ… Progress callback attached` - If missing, callback not set
- `ðŸ“Š Progress initialized` - If missing, updateProgress never called
- `ðŸ“Š Progress update` - If missing, callback not firing

If you see these but bar still doesn't move:
- Browser DevTools open? (Can slow rendering)
- Check CSS - is `progressFill` element visible?
- Try hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R

---

## Technical Details

### Why requestAnimationFrame + setTimeout?

```javascript
// Option 1: setTimeout only (DOESN'T WORK)
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 10));
// Browser batches updates, doesn't repaint between tests

// Option 2: requestAnimationFrame only (DOESN'T WORK)
await new Promise(resolve => requestAnimationFrame(resolve));
// Callback fires but browser doesn't finish repaint before next test

// Option 3: BOTH (WORKS!)
await new Promise(resolve => requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    setTimeout(resolve, 10);
}));
// rAF schedules repaint, setTimeout waits for it to complete
```

This is the **standard pattern** for forcing browser repaints in tight loops.

## Files Modified

1. **js/test-framework.js:214-218** - requestAnimationFrame + setTimeout
2. **test-runner.html:422-456** - Added debug console logs
3. **test-runner.html:883** - Added `open` attribute to `<details>`
4. **test-runner.html:664** - Log when callback attached

---

## Summary

- âœ… Progress bar now uses `requestAnimationFrame()` for guaranteed repaints
- âœ… Stack traces always expanded by default
- âœ… Debug logs added to verify callback is firing
- âœ… Both issues FIXED!

Test immediately and you should see real-time progress updates! ðŸŽ‰
