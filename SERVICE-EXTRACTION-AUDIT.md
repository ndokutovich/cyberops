## üìà Extraction Progress

```
‚úÖ Extracted: 23 services
‚ùå Remaining: ~14 potential services
üìä Completion: ~62%
```

## üîÑ Integration Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Integrated
- All 23 services instantiated in GameServices
- Integration wrapper (`game-services-integration.js`) active
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Services update in game loop
- Test coverage: 100 tests passing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Integration
- Some game files still directly manipulate state
- Not all functionality uses services yet
- Some services could be better integrated

## üìã Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Do Now)
1. **Extract game-flow.js** ‚Üí FlowService, AbilityService, CombatService
2. **Extract game-npc.js** ‚Üí NPCService, DialogService, QuestService
3. **Extract game-events.js** ‚Üí EventHandlerService

### High Priority (Do Next)
4. **Extract game-3d.js** ‚Üí ThreeDService suite
5. **Extract game-loop.js** ‚Üí GameLoopService, UpdateService
6. **Merge duplicate functionality** into existing services

### Medium Priority (Do Later)
7. **Extract game-hub.js** ‚Üí HubService
8. **Extract game-screens.js** ‚Üí ScreenService
9. **Extract game-teamcommands.js** ‚Üí TeamService

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
10. **Extract game-demoscene.js** ‚Üí DemoSceneService
11. **Better integrate RPG files** with RPGService

## üìù Documentation Status

### ‚úÖ Documented
- GAMESERVICES.md - Comprehensive service documentation
- GAMESERVICES-QUICK-REFERENCE.md - Quick reference
- SERVICE-EXTRACTION-AUDIT.md - This audit
- Each service has JSDoc comments

### ‚ùå Not Updated
- CLAUDE.md needs update with new architecture
- README.md should mention service architecture

## üß™ Testing Status

### ‚úÖ What We Test
- Service existence
- Service initialization
- Service integration
- Backward compatibility
- Basic service methods

### ‚ùå What We Don't Test
- Individual unit tests for each service
- Service interaction tests
- Performance tests
- Edge case tests

## üìä Summary

**We have successfully:**
1. ‚úÖ Created 23 services following SOLID principles
2. ‚úÖ Integrated them into the game loop
3. ‚úÖ Maintained backward compatibility
4. ‚úÖ Achieved 100% test pass rate
5. ‚úÖ Documented the architecture

**We still need to:**
1. ‚ùå Extract ~14 more services from monolithic files
2. ‚ùå Update CLAUDE.md with new architecture
3. ‚ùå Add unit tests for individual services
4. ‚ùå Complete extraction of game-flow.js (2,195 lines!)
5. ‚ùå Complete extraction of game-3d.js (2,180 lines!)

**Extraction Completion: ~62%**

While we've made excellent progress, there's still significant work to complete the full service-oriented architecture transformation.
